going. Tiny Budget can help!

### This project is a demonstration purely for prospective employers

#### This app demonstrates my ability to:

* Clearly visualize a product and execute that vision (in this case a web app)
* Create an organized user interface
* Code an express server including:
  * Using the MVC pattern
  * Effective use of middleware
  * Effective use of third-party services (such as MongoLabs)
  * Effective use of tests (unit tests for controllers)
* Code a single page, cross-browser app using knockout
* Use libraries:
  * jQuery
  * Moment
  * Async
* Understand app deployment (using heroku);
* Understand source control

#### Caveats

This app is not perfect

* The API to the server should be organized around resources using various 
HTTP actions to manipulate them, not just GET
* Data sent to server is encoded in the url's querystring instead of in the 
request body (including session tokens and passwords, exposing confidential 
user information)
* The client app isn't cleanly organized and doesn't make effective use of 
common javascript patterns. In the future I would like to
  * Implement better control flow patterns
  * Integrate a validation library
  * Break up the large viewmodel into smaller, more maintainable viewmodels
* Sessions are not persisted client-side; reloading the page forces another
login
